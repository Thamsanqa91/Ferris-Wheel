# Ferris Wheel

## Overview
This project is a visual representation of a Ferris Wheel, created entirely with HTML and CSS. The wheel features rotating spokes and cabins, mimicking the motion of a real Ferris Wheel. The cabins not only rotate but also change colors at different points in the animation cycle, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the Ferris Wheel, including the divs and spans that represent the wheel and its components.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the Ferris Wheel, controls its animation, and applies the necessary visual effects.
- **README.md**: This file, providing a detailed description of the project, instructions for setup, and explanations of the various components used.

## Features
- **Circular Wheel Structure**: The Ferris Wheel is constructed using a combination of divs and spans, with a circular border that represents the wheel.
- **Rotating Spokes**: The spokes of the wheel are represented by `span` elements, each rotated at specific angles using the CSS `transform` property to create an even, radial design.
- **Animated Cabins**: The cabins are positioned around the wheel and are animated to simulate the movement of a real Ferris Wheel. Each cabin rotates in the opposite direction of the wheel to maintain an upright position, similar to how real Ferris Wheel cabins behave.
- **Smooth Color Transitions**: The cabins also change colors smoothly during the animation cycle, transitioning between yellow and purple, adding an extra layer of visual interest.

## How to View the Project
